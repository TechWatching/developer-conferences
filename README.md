# Developer Conferences

A modern Nuxt 3 application that allows users to explore developer conferences from around the world.

This project is based on the amazing open source project [Developer Conferences Agenda](https://github.com/scraly/developers-conferences-agenda) by [Aur√©lie Vache](https://github.com/scraly) that lists in a GitHub repository all the developer conferences and CFPs in the world. This Nuxt application completely relies on the data provided by the [Developer Conferences Agenda](https://github.com/scraly/developers-conferences-agenda) repository and is not meant to be a replacement for it, nor a replacement for its website [developers.events](https://developers.events) that provides a nice way to explore the conferences.

This project is a personal initiative to learn and experiment with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode to create a simple website using Nuxt. I happened to choose to test GitHub Copilot Agent Mode to develop a small website that lists developer conferences, using the data publicly made available by the Developer Conferences Agenda project.

This project is not affiliated with the original project or its maintainers, but I encourage you to check their [repository](https://github.com/scraly/developers-conferences-agenda) and show your support with a star.
