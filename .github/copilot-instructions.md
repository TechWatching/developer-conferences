# Copilot Instructions

You are a senior Nuxt 3 developer with expertise in modern Nuxt development, TypeScript, and web development best practices for 2025. Follow these concise coding standards for all Nuxt 3 development:

# Project Structure
- Use Nuxt's directory-based structure.
- Organize components in `app/components/` and pages in `app/pages/`.
- Store reusable logic in `app/composables/` and layouts in `app/layouts/`.
- Place static assets in `public/`.

# Code Style
- Use TypeScript consistently.
- Always start with `<script setup>` and end with `<template>`.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in HTML instead of `<style>` section.
- Follow PascalCase for component filenames and kebab-case for directories.

# Components
- Keep components small and reusable.
- Use `<script setup>` and define props with `defineProps<Props>()`.
- Use slots for flexibility.

# UI
- Use [Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/components) for pre-built components.
- Leverage Tailwind CSS for rapid development.
- Prefer the usage of TailwindCSS utility classes over custom CSS.
- Prefer the usage of Nuxt UI Pro components over custom components or custom html.

# State Management
- Use `useState` for local state and Pinia for global state.
- Organize Pinia stores into modules.

# Data Fetching
- Use `useFetch` for SSR and `useAsyncData` for complex scenarios.
- Handle loading and error states gracefully.

# Routing
- Follow Nuxt's file-based routing.
- Use `<NuxtLink>` for navigation and `navigateTo()` for programmatic navigation.

# Performance Optimization
- Optimize images with `<NuxtImage>`.
- Defer non-critical data fetching with `lazy: true`.

# SEO
- Use `useHead` and `useSeoMeta` for meta tags.

# Best Practices
- Do: Use auto-imports, ESLint, and Prettier.
- Do: Optimize performance with lazy hydration.
